# Release acceptance

Release acceptance proves the extension on representative Magento runtimes and proves each generated artifact at the boundary where it is consumed.

> Documentation baseline: public repository commit `b77605d`. Last reviewed: 2026-08-29.

The repository's [`ACCEPTANCE-TEST-PLAN.md`](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-shopping-feed/blob/main/ACCEPTANCE-TEST-PLAN.md) is the detailed test source. This page describes the evidence expected from a release candidate.

## Required profiles

Test the release candidate against the supported Mage-OS and Magento Open Source profiles declared by Composer and CI. Include a store with cron, writable media and log directories, storefront product pages, and representative simple and complex products.

Features that need additional fixtures should be tested with them:

* MSI sources, website stocks, and reservations for Local Inventory
* Active cart price rules for Promotions
* Configurable products with swatch and select attributes for deep links
* An existing consent-managed Google tag integration for direct `view_item` delivery
* A quarantine FTP or SFTP target for transfer tests

## Acceptance layers

| Layer | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Installation | Module enables, setup completes, Admin route and ACL work, no legacy package is required |
| Configuration | Every feed tab saves and reloads accurately at the intended scope |
| Product data | Expected headers, stable row shape, sampled values, price behavior, and complex-product output |
| Operations | Manual run, queue, cron, batch continuation, locking, atomic final file, logging, and retries |
| Integrations | Local Inventory, Promotions, schema.org, deep links, `view_item`, and uploads where enabled |
| Compatibility | CI and runtime evidence for the supported platform matrix |
| Upgrade | Clean install and upgrade from the previous Mage-OS module release |

## Safety rules

* Use test products, stores, rules, credentials, and destinations.
* Do not point an unaccepted feed at a serving endpoint.
* Do not enable live ad event delivery without the site's consent and tag owners.
* Do not infer Google acceptance from a locally valid-looking file. Capture the current account diagnostic or API result.
* Do not infer production readiness from unit tests or CI alone.

## Release record

Record the exact commit and package artifact, environment versions, validation output, generated file checksums, sampled expected-versus-actual data, external diagnostics, unresolved limitations, and cleanup result.

Track prepared, locally verified, committed, pushed, CI green, released, installed, externally accepted, and live-verified as separate states. Approval for one state does not imply the next.
